# C++ Training
A couple exercices for my C++ course.

Week 1:
  - Exercices:
    - [X] is_prime_prog
    - [X] find_motive

- Code Rewiew \([Group](https://github.com/6monnn/cpp)\):
    - [ ] is_prime_prog:
      - Code uses argv / argc
      - Code does not read from stdin (code is wrong then).
      - Prime number function is na√Øve.
      - CMake works.
    - [X] find_motive:
      - Code seems right and works.
      - Use 'find' instead of 'regex' but it's fine.
      - CMake works.
